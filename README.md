# Rowdy's Dining App 

## Overview

This repository contains both the backend and frontend for the Rowdy's Dining App, which is a platform for managing dining services. The backend is built using **Spring Boot** (Java), and the database is **MySQL**. The frontend for this app is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using **React** and **TypeScript**.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: 
  - **Java** with **Spring Boot**
  - **MySQL** for the database
  - **JPA/Hibernate** for object-relational mapping (ORM)
  - **Spring Security** for user authentication and authorization
  - **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions
  - **Spring Web** for RESTful APIs
  - **JSON Web Token** for JWT Authentication

- **Frontend**:
  - **React** SPA (Single Page Application)
  - **TypeScript** for type safety
  - **Axios** for HTTP requests to interact with the backend
  - **Tailwind CSS** for styling
  - **React Router** for navigation

     spring.datasource.username=<your_username>
     spring.datasource.password=<your_password>
     spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
     ```

4. **Run the backend**:
   - To run the backend server locally:
   
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
